Penumbra is a dynamic text based rpg, with a procedural world and almost infinite things to do, including a extremely realistic economy,  endless magic you can learn, almost endless items and more.

So this is Penumbra its a text rpg we made in python, the whole world is procedural so it just keeps going forever when you explore, its got a npc economy where they buy and sell and craft stuff and the prices change based on supply and demand, the combat is turn based and super detailed and the magic system is layered as fuck, your actions actually change factions and the world history log tracks everything, the world is always running in the background its pretty cool obv
a fully simulated economy with npcs buying and selling stuff, prices change all the time based on supply and demand and even inflation a massive procedural world that just keeps generating as you explore it, every game is different, the combat is detailed turn based combat with crits and dodges and armor breaking and all that, a super deep magic system with different elements and spells that are all data driven so they scale with your stats, real survival mechanics where you actually have to deal with hunger and thirst and temperature, it affects your stats if you dont manage it, living npcs that have their own lives they work and trade and remember what you do to them.
